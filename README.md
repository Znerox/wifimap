Put collected network data by the WiGLE Android app in a self-hosted database, overlay it on Google Maps with extensive filtering options.
It's also possible to combine this with data captured by airodump-ng on Linux, connect it with the data from WiGLE, and potentially see which clients that have probed or been connected to networks in your database.

It's now possible to run in Docker, see [Wiki](https://github.com/Znerox/wifimap/wiki/Running-in-Docker-(recommended)) for details.
